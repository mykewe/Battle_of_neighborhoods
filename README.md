## Introduction/Business Problem
Determining the best locations to open a restaurant in Newyork and Toronto. The solution to this problem would help investors intereted in opening restaurants to decide where their business could thrive the most.

## Data description
I would be using the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City and Toronto. I will use the explore function to get the most common restaurants in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters.
